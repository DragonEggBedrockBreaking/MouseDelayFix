# MouseDelayFix

## Description

Fixes [MC-67665](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67665). This is not a legacy fabric port of [MouseDelayFix for Forge](https://github.com/prplz/MouseDelayFix), since it does not use their fix, rather it uses the fix implemented in 1.11 by Mojang. However, I used its README as a reference.
